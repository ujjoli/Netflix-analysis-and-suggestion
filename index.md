## Introduction of the topic


Netflix is popular online streaming service that offers a wide variety of award-winning TV shows, movies, anime, documentaries, and more on thousands of internet-connected devices. It is being popular as you can watch as much as you want, whenever you want without a single commercial – all for one low monthly price. With the streaming service, people are getting choice to watch movies online at home with their family. I mean who does not like this service, right? But, along with this service, are the contents of Netflix qualitative (highly rated)? People have their own choices, so is Netflix providing abundant variety of choices of contents? What genre are most popular in netflix? Keeping this question in mind, I am sure that some people love Netflix, and some don't. So what is actually netflix missing? How can it increase the likeable contents based on the popularity of its present context? Can I recommend some contents of netflix? How does recommendation system work? What if we can predict the rating for netflix and even provide some suggestion in regard to the content it has based on directors.

Put netflix image here.

Therefore, to answer these questions, my project is going to analyze the data from netflix. I am going to start with general analysis and come up with the suggestion and recommendation model for netflix and users.
